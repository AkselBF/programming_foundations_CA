The "Car" const value contains several types of elements:

- "brand" is a String, giving the const a name
- "running" is a boolean
- "gear" is an array of 4 different elements, which actually come into
  play for the function.

- "Gear ratio" is my function
The function includes numbers and the "gear" array.

By entering a number at the very end of the code from 0 to 30, a value from 
the array will be logged out along the the number (speed) it belongs to.
f.ex.: if it's 0 the gear is "Neutral", or if the speed is at 45 the gear
will be at "Third".
